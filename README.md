# Diabetes - Business Problem

Diabetes is a chronic long-lasting health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Diabetes often leads to cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney damage, and long-term damage to the extremities such as the limbs and eyes.

In this project, we will use machine learning algorithms to address the issue of diabetes. We will use the labeled vital measurements of the patients for example, "Age and Blood Insulin Level" from data then train them using machine learning neural networks to make predictions on new patients.

## The Diabetes Dataset

The dataset that will be used in this project is obtained from the Pima Indians Diebetes dataset, as provided by the National Institute of Diabtes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases and hosted by Kaggle.
